 Apache Airlines - Seat Booking System (PART A)
==============================================================================
Module      : FC723 - Programming Theory
Assignment  : Final Project - Part A, Task 4 & 5
Author      : P489993

DESCRIPTION
-----------
This program manages seat bookings for a Burak757 aircraft. The aircraft
layout is 80 rows (1-80) and 6 columns (A-F). Column layout per row:

    A  B  C   X   D  E  F
    (seats)  (aisle)  (seats)

Rows 77-78 in columns D and E are reserved for STORAGE ("S") and cannot
be booked. Column "X" is not a real seat column -- it represents the
aisle and is skipped when the seat map is built.

Each seat can be in one of the following states, stored in a dictionary
keyed by seat id (e.g. "12A"):
    "F"  -> Free        (available to book)
    "R"  -> Reserved     (already booked)
    "X"  -> Aisle        (never booked)
    "S"  -> Storage area (never booked)

The program presents a text menu that stays on screen until the user
chooses to exit (Task 4). Task 5 adds one extra feature not requested
in the original brief: searching for a booking by seat, and a simple
"free-seat count" summary, to demonstrate an enhancement a real airline
booking system would need. All functions are documented with docstrings
so that this file can later be used to auto-generate documentation
(e.g. with pydoc / Sphinx).
